# Precision medicine matching system

#### Introduction
Aiming at consolidating the bridge between NGS and clinic medication, we have developed precision medicine matching system as a solution for
doctors and researchers to understand patientsâ€™ NGS data by mapping clinically significant variant 
revealed by annotated NGS data to PharmGKB pharmacogenetics data (Barbarino et al., 2018). To 
construct the system using PharmGKB data and display it as a user-friendly web application 
software, we have adopted Spring-MVC architecture which follows J2EE standards. The following 
software testing report describes the performance of the software during the course of 
development, which provides traceable information for development team, technical users and business users.
